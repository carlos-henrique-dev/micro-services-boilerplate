# Micro-services boilerplate (WIP)

## About

This is a boilerplate of a project structure with microservices using nginx as a reverse proxy to redirect the requests based on the /path.
The client can consume from one domain (`ex: domain.com/products, domain.com/sales`) and the backend will handle who gets the requests
